# Codemy.com — Python Programming For Everyone
### Projects and exercises completed while following John Elder’s course

This repository contains all of my work from the Codemy.com **Python Programming For Everyone** course.  
Each lesson is recreated step‑by‑step with clean code, organized examples, and clear explanations to reinforce core Python fundamentals.

## What’s Inside
- Individual lesson files with improved, Pythonic structure  
- Teaching notes and summary blocks for future reference  
- Extra examples expanding on the instructor’s material  
- Clean, readable scripts focused on learning and mastery  
- A consistent folder structure for easy navigation  

## Topics Covered
- Variables, strings, numbers, and basic data types  
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets  
- Conditionals and loops  
- Functions and modules  
- File handling  
- Intro to classes and object‑oriented concepts  
- Small projects and hands‑on exercises  

## Purpose
This repo serves as a personal learning archive and a reference for revisiting Python fundamentals.  
All code is written by **Jose “Joe” Ruiz**, following the course while improving readability, structure, and clarity.

## Notes
This repository is for educational use only and follows along with the Codemy.com curriculum.
